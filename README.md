ðŸš€ Setup and Installation
To get this project running locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/GN-30/PING-Quick-Learning-App-

2. Install Dependencies
Install all the necessary packages for the project.

npm install

3. Set Up Environment Variables
This is the most crucial step. The application requires API keys from both Firebase and your Mistral API provider to function.

Create a new file in the root directory of the project named .env.

Copy the following content into the .env file and fill in your unique keys. Do not use quotes around the keys.

# Firebase Configuration
VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_firebase_api_key
VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_firebase_auth_domain
VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_firebase_project_id
VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_firebase_storage_bucket
VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_firebase_messaging_sender_id
VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_firebase_app_id
VITE_MEASUREMENT_ID=your_firebase_measurement_id

# Mistral AI Configuration
VITE_MISTRAL_API_KEY=your_mistral_api_key

You can find your Firebase configuration details in your Firebase project settings.

4. Start the Development Server
Once the dependencies are installed and your environment variables are set, you can start the app.

npm run dev

The application should now be running on http://localhost:5173 (or another port if 5173 is in use).

Usage
Sign Up / Login to your account.

If you are a new user, select your topics of interest.

On the main feed page, press the ArrowDown key on your keyboard to fetch a new fact.
